We recognize that alternative deep learning strategies (hyperparameter
choice, training data selection, etc.) could provide comparable and even
superior performance to what was presented.  However, that is precisely
our point---deep learning, generally, presents a much better alternative
than histogram approaches as network training directly takes place in
the image (i.e., spatial) domain and not in a transformed space where
key information has been discarded.
