We recognize that alternative deep learning strategies (hyperparameter
choice, training data selection, etc.) could provide comparable and even
superior performance to what was presented.  However, that is precisely
our point---deep learning, generally, presents a much better alternative
than what is used currently and we hope that this motivates the field
to explore such possible improvements.
