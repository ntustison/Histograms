	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the performance of a semiautomated ventilation defect segmentation approach, adaptive K-means, with manual segmentation of hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging in subjects with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six subjects with EIB underwent hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging and spirometry tests at baseline, post exercise, and recovery over two separate visits. Ventilation defects were analyzed by two methods. First, two independent readers manually segmented ventilation defects. Second, defects were quantified by an adaptive K-means method that corrected for coil sensitivity, applied a vesselness filter to estimate pulmonary vasculature, and segmented defects adaptively based on the overall low-intensity signals in the lungs. These two methods were then compared in four aspects: (1) ventilation defect percent (VDP) measurements, (2) correlation between spirometric measures and measured VDP, (3) regional VDP variations pre- and post exercise challenge, and (4) Dice coefficient for spatial agreement.
RESULTS: The adaptive K-means method was ~5 times faster, and the measured VDP bias was under 2%. The correlation between predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second over forced vital capacity and VDP measured by adaptive K-means (ρ = -0.64, P <0.0001) and by the manual method (ρ = -0.63, P <0.0001) yielded almost identical 95% confidence intervals. Neither method of measuring VDP indicated apical/basal or anterior dependence in this small study cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the manual method, the adaptive K-means method provided faster, reproducible, comparable measures of VDP in EIB and may be applied to a variety of lung diseases.},

	abstract = {Combat military and civilian law enforcement personnel may be exposed to repetitive low-intensity blast events during training and operations. Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as "breachers" or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Super resolution problems are widely discussed in medical imaging. Spatial resolution of medical images are not sufficient due to the constraints such as image acquisition time, low irradiation dose or hardware limits. To address these problems, different super resolution methods have been proposed, such as optimization or learning-based approaches. Recently, deep learning methods become a thriving technology and are developing at an exponential speed. We think it is necessary to write a review to present the current situation of deep learning in medical imaging super resolution. In this paper, we first briefly introduce deep learning methods, then present a number of important deep learning approaches to solve super resolution problems, different architectures as well as up-sampling operations will be introduced. Afterwards, we focus on the applications of deep learning methods in medical imaging super resolution problems, the challenges to overcome will be presented as well.},

@article{Boer:2010aa,
	abstract = {The ability to study changes in brain morphometry in longitudinal studies majorly depends on the accuracy and reproducibility of the brain tissue quantification. We evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of four previously proposed automatic brain tissue segmentation methods: FAST, SPM5, an automatically trained k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, and a conventional kNN classifier based on a prior training set. The intensity nonuniformity correction and skull-stripping mask were the same for all methods. Evaluations were performed on MRI scans of elderly subjects derived from the general population. Accuracy was evaluated by comparison to two manual segmentations of MRI scans of six subjects (mean age 65.9+/-4.4 years). Reproducibility was assessed by comparing the automatic segmentations of 30 subjects (mean age 57.0+/-3.7 years) who were scanned twice within a short time interval. All methods showed good accuracy and reproducibility, with only small differences between methods. The conventional kNN classifier was the most accurate method with similarity indices of 0.82/0.90/0.94 for cerebrospinal fluid/gray matter/white matter, but it showed the lowest reproducibility. FAST yielded the most reproducible segmentation volumes with volume difference standard deviations of 0.55/0.49/0.38 (percentage of intracranial volume) respectively. The results of the reproducibility experiment can be used to calculate the required number of subjects in the design of a longitudinal study with sufficient power to detect changes over time in brain (tissue) volume. Example sample size calculations demonstrate a rather large effect of the choice of segmentation method on the required number of subjects.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a validation study on statistical nonsupervised brain tissue classification techniques in magnetic resonance (MR) images. Several image models assuming different hypotheses regarding the intensity distribution model, the spatial model and the number of classes are assessed. The methods are tested on simulated data for which the classification ground truth is known. Different noise and intensity nonuniformities are added to simulate real imaging conditions. No enhancement of the image quality is considered either before or during the classification process. This way, the accuracy of the methods and their robustness against image artifacts are tested. Classification is also performed on real data where a quantitative validation compares the methods' results with an estimated ground truth from manual segmentations by experts. Validity of the various classification methods in the labeling of the image as well as in the tissue volume is estimated with different local and global measures. Results demonstrate that methods relying on both intensity and spatial information are more robust to noise and field inhomogeneities. We also demonstrate that partial volume is not perfectly modeled, even though methods that account for mixture classes outperform methods that only consider pure Gaussian classes. Finally, we show that simulated data results can also be extended to real data.},

	abstract = {Image segmentation is one of the most important tasks in medical image analysis and is often the first and the most critical step in many clinical applications. In brain MRI analysis, image segmentation is commonly used for measuring and visualizing the brain's anatomical structures, for analyzing brain changes, for delineating pathological regions, and for surgical planning and image-guided interventions. In the last few decades, various segmentation techniques of different accuracy and degree of complexity have been developed and reported in the literature. In this paper we review the most popular methods commonly used for brain MRI segmentation. We highlight differences between them and discuss their capabilities, advantages, and limitations. To address the complexity and challenges of the brain MRI segmentation problem, we first introduce the basic concepts of image segmentation. Then, we explain different MRI preprocessing steps including image registration, bias field correction, and removal of nonbrain tissue. Finally, after reviewing different brain MRI segmentation methods, we discuss the validation problem in brain MRI segmentation. },

@article{Bezdek:1993aa,
	abstract = {This paper has reviewed, with somewhat variable coverage, the nine MR image segmentation techniques itemized in Table II. A wide array of approaches have been discussed; each has its merits and drawbacks. We have also given pointers to other approaches not discussed in depth in this review. The methods reviewed fall roughly into four model groups: c-means, maximum likelihood, neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor rules. Both supervised and unsupervised schemes require human intervention to obtain clinically useful results in MR segmentation. Unsupervised techniques require somewhat less interaction on a per patient/image basis. Maximum likelihood techniques have had some success, but are very susceptible to the choice of training region, which may need to be chosen slice by slice for even one patient. Generally, techniques that must assume an underlying statistical distribution of the data (such as LML and UML) do not appear promising, since tissue regions of interest do not usually obey the distributional tendencies of probability density functions. The most promising supervised techniques reviewed seem to be FF/NN methods that allow hidden layers to be configured as examples are presented to the system. An example of a self-configuring network, FF/CC, was also discussed. The relatively simple k-nearest neighbor rule algorithms (hard and fuzzy) have also shown promise in the supervised category. Unsupervised techniques based upon fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms have also shown great promise in MR image segmentation. Several unsupervised connectionist techniques have recently been experimented with on MR images of the brain and have provided promising initial results. A pixel-intensity-based edge detection algorithm has recently been used to provide promising segmentations of the brain. This is also an unsupervised technique, older versions of which have been susceptible to oversegmenting the image because of the lack of clear boundaries between tissue types or finding uninteresting boundaries between slightly different types of the same tissue. To conclude, we offer some remarks about improving MR segmentation techniques. The better unsupervised techniques are too slow. Improving speed via parallelization and optimization will improve their competitiveness with, e.g., the k-nn rule, which is the fastest technique covered in this review. Another area for development is dynamic cluster validity. Unsupervised methods need better ways to specify and adjust c, the number of tissue classes found by the algorithm. Initialization is a third important area of research. Many of the schemes listed in Table II are sensitive to good initialization, both in terms of the parameters of the design, as well as operator selection of training data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive pulmonary disease that is ultimately fatal. Although the diagnosis of IPF has been revolutionized by high-resolution computed tomography, this imaging modality still exhibits significant limitations, particularly in assessing disease progression and therapy response. The need for noninvasive regional assessment has become more acute in light of recently introduced novel therapies and numerous others in the pipeline. Thus, it will likely be valuable to complement 3-dimensional imaging of lung structure with 3-dimensional regional assessment of function. This challenge is well addressed by hyperpolarized (HP) Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), exploiting the unique properties of this inert gas to image its distribution, not only in the airspaces, but also in the interstitial barrier tissues and red blood cells. This single-breath imaging exam could ultimately become the ideal, noninvasive tool to assess pulmonary gas-exchange impairment in IPF. This review article will detail the evolution of HP Xe MRI from its early development to its current state as a clinical research platform. It will detail the key imaging biomarkers that can be generated from the Xe MRI examination, as well as their potential in IPF for diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of therapeutic response. We conclude by discussing the types of studies that must be performed for HP Xe MRI to be incorporated into the IPF clinical algorithm and begin to positively impact IPF disease diagnosis and management.},

	abstract = {Conventional pulmonary function tests appear normal in early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Therefore, new diagnostic approaches are required that can detect CF lung disease in children and monitor treatment response. Hyperpolarized (HP) gas (129Xe and 3He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful, emergent tool for mapping regional lung function and may be well suited for studying pediatric CF. HP gas MRI is well tolerated, reproducible, and it can be performed longitudinally without the need for ionizing radiation. In particular, quantification of the distribution of ventilation, or ventilation defect percent (VDP), has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of CF lung disease and correlates well with pulmonary function tests. This article presents the current state of CF diagnosis and treatment and describes the potential role of HP gas MRI for detection of early CF lung disease and following the effects of interventions. The typical HP gas imaging workflow is described, along with a discussion of image analysis to calculate VDP, dosing considerations, and the reproducibility of VDP. The potential use of VDP as an outcome measure in CF is discussed, by considering the correlation with pulmonary function measures, preliminary interventional studies, and case studies involving longitudinal imaging and pulmonary exacerbations. Finally, emerging HP gas imaging techniques such as multiple breath washout imaging are introduced, followed by a discussion of future directions. Overall, HP gas MRI biomarkers are expected to provide sensitive outcome measures that can be used in disease surveillance as well as interventional studies involving novel CF therapies.},

Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

The major challenge is the number of patients who are incorrectly diagnosed. To address this, we developed an expert diagnostic system that can differentiate among patients with asthma, COPD or a normal lung function based on measurements of lung function and information about patient's symptoms. To develop accurate classification algorithms, data from 3657 patients were used and then independently verified using data from 1650 patients collected over a period of two years. Our results demonstrate that the expert diagnostic system can correctly identify patients with asthma and COPD with sensitivity of 96.45% and specificity of 98.71%. Additionally, 98.71% of the patients with a normal lung function were correctly classified, which contributed to a 49.23% decrease in demand for conducting additional tests, therefore decreasing financial cost.},

@article{Couch:2019aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ventilation defect percent (VDP), measured from hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is sensitive to functional changes in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. The purpose of this study was to measure and compare VDP from HP 129Xe MRI acquired at two institutions in stable pediatric CF subjects with preserved lung function.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 26 participants from two institutions (18 CF, 8 healthy, age range 10-17). Pulmonary function tests, N2 multiple breath washout (to measure lung clearance index, LCI), and HP 129Xe MRI were performed. VDP measurements were compared between two trained analysts using mean-anchored linear binning. Correlations were investigated for VDP compared to the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and LCI.
RESULTS: VDP measurements agreed for the two analysts with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.99. In the combined dataset, VDP measured by Analyst 1 was 5.96 $\pm$ 1.82% and 15.96 $\pm$ 6.76% for the healthy and CF groups, respectively (p = .0004). Analyst 2 showed similar differences between healthy and CF (p = .0003). VDP measured by either analyst was shown to correlate with FEV1 (R2 = 0.33, p = .003; and R2 = 0.26, p = .009 for Analysts 1 and 2, respectively) and LCI (R2 = 0.76, p < .0001; and R2 = 0.77, p < .0001 for Analysts 1 and 2, respectively).
CONCLUSION: HP 129Xe MRI provides a robust measurement of ventilation heterogeneity in stable pediatric CF subjects at two sites. Since measurements performed at two sites yielded similar VDP values with near-identical values between different analysts, implementation of the technique in multi-center trials in CF appears feasible.},

@article{Warfield:2004aa,
	abstract = {Characterizing the performance of image segmentation approaches has been a persistent challenge. Performance analysis is important since segmentation algorithms often have limited accuracy and precision. Interactive drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has often been the only acceptable approach, and yet suffers from intra-rater and inter-rater variability. Automated algorithms have been sought in order to remove the variability introduced by raters, but such algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable for the task. The performance of raters (human or algorithmic) generating segmentations of medical images has been difficult to quantify because of the difficulty of obtaining or estimating a known true segmentation for clinical data. Although physical and digital phantoms can be constructed for which ground truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty of constructing phantoms which reproduce the full range of imaging characteristics and normal and pathological anatomical variability observed in clinical data. Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters is an attractive alternative since it can be carried out directly on the relevant clinical imaging data. However, the most appropriate measure or set of measures with which to compare such segmentations has not been clarified and several measures are used in practice. We present here an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers a collection of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation and a measure of the performance level represented by each segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the collection may be an appropriately trained human rater or raters, or may be an automated segmentation algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal combination of the segmentations, weighting each segmentation depending upon the estimated performance level, and incorporating a prior model for the spatial distribution of structures being segmented as well as spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is straightforward to apply to clinical imaging data, it readily enables assessment of the performance of an automated image segmentation algorithm, and enables direct comparison of human rater and algorithm performance.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: 129Xe MRI has been developed to noninvasively visualize and quantify the functional consequence of airway obstruction in asthma. Its widespread application requires evidence of intersite reproducibility and agreement. Our objective was to evaluate reproducibility and agreement of 129Xe ventilation MRI measurements in severe asthmatics at two sites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In seven adults with severe asthma, 129Xe ventilation MRI was acquired pre- and post-bronchodilator at two geographic sites within 24-hours. 129Xe MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated and ventilation abnormalities were quantified as the whole-lung and slice-by-slice ventilation defect percent (VDP). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to determine intersite 129Xe VDP reproducibility and agreement.
RESULTS: Whole-lung and slice-by-slice 129Xe VDP measured at both sites were correlated and reproducible (pre-bronchodilator: whole-lung ICC = 0.90, p = 0.005, slice-by-slice ICC = 0.78, p < 0.0001; post-bronchodilator: whole-lung ICC = 0.94, p < 0.0001, slice-by-slice ICC = 0.83, p < 0.0001) notwithstanding intersite differences in the 129Xe-dose-equivalent-volume (101 $\pm$ 15 mL site 1, 49 $\pm$ 6 mL site 2, p < 0.0001), gas-mixture (129Xe/4He site 1; 129Xe/N2 site 2) and SNR (40 $\pm$ 19 site 1, 23 $\pm$ 5 site 2, p = 0.02). Qualitative 129Xe gas distribution differences were observed between sites and slice-by-slice 129Xe VDP, but not whole-lung 129Xe VDP, was significantly lower at site 1 (pre-bronchodilator VDP: whole-lung bias = -3%, p > 0.99, slice-by-slice bias = -3%, p = 0.0001; post-bronchodilator VDP: whole-lung bias = -2%, p = 0.59, slice-by-slice-bias = -2%, p = 0.0003).
CONCLUSION: 129Xe MRI VDP at two different sites measured within 24-hours in the same severe asthmatics were correlated. Qualitative and quantitative intersite differences in 129Xe regional gas distribution and VDP point to site-specific variability that may be due to differences in gas-mixture composition or SNR.},

	abstract = {A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or "pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify regional lung ventilation in healthy volunteers and patients with severe asthma (both before and after thermoplasty) by using a combination of helium 3 ((3)He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT), with the intention of developing more effective image-guided treatments for obstructive lung diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With approval of the local institutional review board, informed consent, and an Investigational New Drug Exemption, six healthy volunteers and 10 patients with severe asthma were imaged in compliance with HIPAA regulations by using both multidetector CT and (3)He MR imaging. Individual bronchopulmonary segments were labeled voxel by voxel from the CT images and then registered to the (3)He MR images by using custom software. The (3)He signal intensity was then analyzed by evaluating the volume-weighted fraction of total-lung signal intensity present in each segment (segmental ventilation percentage [ SVP segmental ventilation percentage ]) and by identifying the whole-lung defect percentage and the segmental defect percentage. Of the 10 patients with asthma, seven received treatment with bronchial thermoplasty and were imaged with (3)He MR a second time. Changes in segmental defect percentages and whole-lung defect percentages are presented.
RESULTS: Ventilation measures for healthy volunteers yielded smaller segment-to-segment variation (mean SVP segmental ventilation percentage , 100% $\pm$ 18 [standard deviation]) than did the measures for patients with severe asthma (mean SVP segmental ventilation percentage , 97% $\pm$ 23). Patients with asthma also demonstrated larger segmental defect percentages (median, 13.5%; interquartile range, 8.9%-17.8%) than healthy volunteers (median, 6%; interquartile range, 5.6%-6.3%). These quantitative results confirm what is visually observed on the (3)He images. A Spearman correlation of r = -0.82 was found between the change in whole-lung defect percentage and the number of days between final treatment and second (3)He imaging.
CONCLUSION: Regional quantification of lung ventilation is indeed feasible and may be a useful technique for image-guided treatment of obstructive lung diseases, such as bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthma. In these patients, ventilation defects decreased as a function of time after treatment.},

@article{Kirby:2012ab,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantitatively compare hyperpolarized helium 3 (3He) and xenon 129 (129Xe) magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained within 5 minutes in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to evaluate the correlations between 3He and 129Xe MR imaging measurements and those from spirometry and plethysmography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by an ethics board and compliant with HIPAA. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Eight healthy volunteers and 10 patients with COPD underwent MR imaging, spirometry, and plethysmography. Ventilation defect percentages (VDPs) at 3He and 129Xe imaging were obtained by using semiautomated segmentation. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were calculated from 3He (b=1.6 sec/cm2) and 129Xe (b=12 sec/cm2) diffusion-weighted images. VDPs at hyperpolarized 3He and 129Xe imaging were compared with a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test and analysis of variance; Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships among measurements.
RESULTS: 129Xe VDP was significantly greater than 3He VDP for patients with COPD (P<.0001) but not for healthy volunteers (P=.35), although 3He and 129Xe VDPs showed a significant correlation for all subjects (r=0.91, P<.0001). The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) showed a similar and significant correlation with 3He VDP (r=-0.84, P<.0001) and 129Xe VDP (r=-0.89, P<.0001), although the correlation between the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and 129Xe VDP (r=-0.95, P<.0001) was significantly greater (P=.01) than that for FEV1/FVC and 3He VDP (r=-0.84, P<.0001). A significant correlation was also observed for 3He and 129Xe ADC (r=0.97, P<.0001); 129Xe ADC was significantly correlated with diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (r=-0.79, P=.03) and computed tomographic emphysema measurements (areas with attenuation values in the 15th percentile: r=-0.91, P=.0003; relative areas with attenuation values of less than -950 HU: r=0.87, P=.001).
CONCLUSION: In patients with COPD, the VDP obtained with hyperpolarized 29Xe MR imaging was significantly greater than that with 3He MR imaging, suggesting incomplete or delayed filling of lung regions that may be related to the different properties of 129Xe gas and physiologic and/or anatomic abnormalities in COPD.},

@article{Svenningsen:2014aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperpolarised (3)He MRI provides a way to visualise regional pulmonary functional abnormalities that in asthma are thought to be related to airway morphological abnormalities. However, the exact aetiology of ventilation defects in asthma is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand the determinants of ventilation defects in asthma, we evaluated well-established clinical as well as (3)He MRI and X-ray CT airway measurements in healthy subjects and subjects with asthma.
METHODS: Thirty-four subjects (n=26 subjects with asthma, n=8 healthy volunteers) underwent MRI, spirometry, plethysmography, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide analysis, methacholine challenge and CT for a region-of-interest proximal to ventilation defects. For subjects who consented to CT (n=18 subjects with asthma, n=5 healthy volunteers), we evaluated 3(rd) to 5th generation airway wall area and wall thickness per cent and lumen area.
RESULTS: Seventeen subjects with asthma (17/26=65%) had visually obvious evidence of (3)He ventilation defects prior to bronchoprovocation and nine subjects with asthma had no ventilation defects prior to bronchoprovocation (9/26=35%). Subjects with asthma with defects were older (p=0.01) with worse forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (p=0.0003), airways resistance (p=0.004), fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (p=0.03), greater bronchoprovocation concentration of methacholine that reduced FEV1 by 20% (p=0.008) and wall thickness per cent (p=0.02) compared with subjects with asthma without defects. There was a moderate correlation for wall area per cent with ventilation defect per cent (r=0.43, p=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with asthma with (3)He ventilation defects were older with significantly worse airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation and airway remodelling but similar FEV1 as subjects with asthma without defects; hyperpolarised (3)He ventilation abnormalities were spatially and quantitatively related to abnormally remodelled airways.},

@article{Schlemper:2019aa,
	abstract = {We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical image analysis that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules when using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN models such as VGG or U-Net architectures with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed AG models are evaluated on a variety of tasks, including medical image classification and segmentation. For classification, we demonstrate the use case of AGs in scan plane detection for fetal ultrasound screening. We show that the proposed attention mechanism can provide efficient object localisation while improving the overall prediction performance by reducing false positives. For segmentation, the proposed architecture is evaluated on two large 3D CT abdominal datasets with manual annotations for multiple organs. Experimental results show that AG models consistently improve the prediction performance of the base architectures across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. Moreover, AGs guide the model activations to be focused around salient regions, which provides better insights into how model predictions are made. The source code for the proposed AG models is publicly available.},

	abstract = {Measures of overlap of labelled regions of images, such as the Dice and Tanimoto coefficients, have been extensively used to evaluate image registration and segmentation algorithms. Modern studies can include multiple labels defined on multiple images yet most evaluation schemes report one overlap per labelled region, simply averaged over multiple images. In this paper, common overlap measures are generalized to measure the total overlap of ensembles of labels defined on multiple test images and account for fractional labels using fuzzy set theory. This framework allows a single "figure-of-merit" to be reported which summarises the results of a complex experiment by image pair, by label or overall. A complementary measure of error, the overlap distance, is defined which captures the spatial extent of the nonoverlapping part and is related to the Hausdorff distance computed on grey level images. The generalized overlap measures are validated on synthetic images for which the overlap can be computed analytically and used as similarity measures in nonrigid registration of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Finally, a pragmatic segmentation ground truth is constructed by registering a magnetic resonance atlas brain to 20 individual scans, and used with the overlap measures to evaluate publicly available brain segmentation algorithms.},

While semantic segmentation algorithms enable image analysis and quantification in many applications, the design of respective specialized solutions is non-trivial and highly dependent on dataset properties and hardware conditions. We developed nnU-Net, a deep learning-based segmentation method that automatically configures itself, including preprocessing, network architecture, training and post-processing for any new task. The key design choices in this process are modeled as a set of fixed parameters, interdependent rules and empirical decisions. Without manual intervention, nnU-Net surpasses most existing approaches, including highly specialized solutions on 23 public datasets used in international biomedical segmentation competitions. We make nnU-Net publicly available as an out-of-the-box tool, rendering state-of-the-art segmentation accessible to a broad audience by requiring neither expert knowledge nor computing resources beyond standard network training.},

The base software library, ANTs, is built upon, and contributes to, the NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit. Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These pipelines significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs workflows and simultaneously illustrate the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:None.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In this study, we compared hyperpolarized 3He and 129Xe images from patients with cystic fibrosis using two commonly applied magnetic resonance sequences, standard gradient echo (GRE) and balanced steady-state free precession (TrueFISP) to quantify regional similarities and differences in signal distribution and defect analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients (7M/3F) with cystic fibrosis underwent hyperpolarized gas MR imaging with both 3He and 129Xe. Six had MRI with both GRE, and TrueFISP sequences and four patients had only GRE sequence but not TrueFISP. Ventilation defect percentages (VDPs) were calculated as lung voxels with <60% of the whole-lung hyperpolarized gas signal mean and was measured in all datasets. The voxel signal distributions of both 129Xe and 3He gases were visualized and compared using violin plots. VDPs of hyperpolarized 3 He and 129 Xe were compared in Bland-Altman plots; Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships between inter-gas and inter-scan to assess the reproducibility.
RESULTS: A significant correlation was demonstrated between 129Xe VDP and 3He VDP for both GRE and TrueFISP sequences (ρ = 0.78, p<0.0004). The correlation between the GRE and TrueFISP VDP for 3He was ρ = 0.98 and was ρ = 0.91 for 129Xe. Overall, 129Xe (27.2$\pm$9.4) VDP was higher than 3He (24.3$\pm$6.9) VDP on average on cystic fibrosis patients.
CONCLUSION: In patients with cystic fibrosis, the selection of hyperpolarized 129Xe or 3He gas is most likely inconsequential when it comes to measure the overall lung function by VDP although 129Xe may be more sensitive to starker lung defects, particularly when using a TrueFISP sequence.},

	abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

	abstract = {Texture analysis methods quantify the spatial variations in gray level values within an image and thus can provide useful information on the structures observed. However, they are sensitive to acquisition conditions due to the use of different protocols and to intra- and interscanner variations in the case of MRI. The influence was studied of two protocols and four different conditions of normalization of gray levels on the discrimination power of texture analysis methods applied to soft cheeses. Thirty-two samples of soft cheese were chosen at two different ripening periods (16 young and 16 old samples) in order to obtain two different microscopic structures of the protein gel. Proton density and T(2)-weighted MR images were acquired using a spin echo sequence on a 0.2 T scanner. Gray levels were normalized according to four methods: original gray levels, same maximum for all images, same mean for all images, and dynamics limited to micro +/- 3sigma. Regions of interest were automatically defined, and texture descriptors were then computed for the co-occurrence matrix, run length matrix, gradient matrix, autoregressive model, and wavelet transform. The features with the lowest probability of error and average correlation coefficient were selected and used for classification with 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) classifier. The best results were obtained when using the limitation of dynamics to micro +/- 3sigma, which enhanced the differences between the two classes. The results demonstrated the influence of the normalization method and of the acquisition protocol on the effectiveness of the classification and also on the parameters selected for classification. These results indicate the need to evaluate sensitivity to MR acquisition protocols and to gray level normalization methods when texture analysis is required.},

The essential parts of this approach to automatic windowing are (1) avoidance of irrelevant pixels, (2) identification of the type of MR image from information stored in the image header, and (3) use of algorithms for the maximum and minimum values that reflect the preference of the intended viewer using a specific monitor and ambient lighting conditions for the different types of images.

	abstract = {The paper is focused on a tiSsue-Based Standardization Technique (SBST) of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. Magnetic Resonance Imaging intensities have no fixed tissue-specific numeric meaning, even within the same MRI protocol, for the same body region, or even for images of the same patient obtained on the same scanner in different moments. This affects postprocessing tasks such as automatic segmentation or unsupervised/supervised classification methods, which strictly depend on the observed image intensities, compromising the accuracy and efficiency of many image analyses algorithms. A large number of MR images from public databases, belonging to healthy people and to patients with different degrees of neurodegenerative pathology, were employed together with synthetic MRIs. Combining both histogram and tissue-specific intensity information, a correspondence is obtained for each tissue across images. The novelty consists of computing three standardizing transformations for the three main brain tissues, for each tissue class separately. In order to create a continuous intensity mapping, spline smoothing of the overall slightly discontinuous piecewise-linear intensity transformation is performed. The robustness of the technique is assessed in a post hoc manner, by verifying that automatic segmentation of images before and after standardization gives a high overlapping (Dice index >0.9) for each tissue class, even across images coming from different sources. Furthermore, SBST efficacy is tested by evaluating if and how much it increases intertissue discrimination and by assessing gaussianity of tissue gray-level distributions before and after standardization. Some quantitative comparisons to already existing different approaches available in the literature are performed. },

	abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the lack of a standard and quantifiable interpretation of image intensities. Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. We have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a way that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.},

	abstract = {The lack of a standard image intensity scale in MRI causes many difficulties in image display and analysis. A two-step postprocessing method is proposed for standardizing the intensity scale in such a way that for the same MR protocol and body region, similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. In the first step, the parameters of the standardizing transformation are "learned" from a set of images. In the second step, for each MR study these parameters are used to map their histogram into the standardized histogram. The method was tested quantitatively on 90 whole-brain studies of multiple sclerosis patients for several protocols and qualitatively for several other protocols and body regions. Measurements using mean squared difference showed that the standardized image intensities have statistically significantly (P < 0.01) more consistent range and meaning than the originals. Fixed gray level windows can be established for the standardized images and used for display without the need of per case adjustment. Preliminary results also indicate that the method facilitates improving the degree of automation of image segmentation. Magn Reson Med 42:1072-1081, 1999.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To improve intra- and interobserver variability and enable the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for multicenter, multiobserver studies, we generated a semiautomated segmentation method for hyperpolarized helium-3 ((3)He) MRI. Therefore the objective of this study was to compare the reproducibility and spatial agreement of manual and semiautomated segmentation of (3)He MRI ventilation defect volume (VDV) and ventilation volume (VV) in subjects with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The multistep semiautomated segmentation method we developed employed hierarchical K-means clustering to classify (3)He MRI pixel intensity values into five user-determined clusters ranging from signal void to hyperintense. A seeded region-growing algorithm was also used to segment the (1)H MRI thoracic cavity for coregistration to the (3)He cluster-map, generating VDV and VV.
RESULTS: We compared manual segmentation performed by an expert observer and semiautomated measurements of (3)He MRI VDV and observed strong significant correlations between the volumes generated using each method (asthma, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001; COPD, n = 5, r = 0.84, P < .0001; CF, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001). Semiautomated VDV had high interobserver reproducibility (coefficient of variation [CV] = 7%, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96); intraobserver reproducibility was significantly higher for semiautomated (CV = 5%, ICC = 1.00) compared to manual VDV (CV = 12%, ICC = 0.98). Spatial agreement for VV determined using the Dice coefficient (D) was also high for all disease states (asthma, D = 0.95; COPD, D = 0.88; CF, D = 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated segmentation (3)He MRI provides excellent inter- and intraobserver precision with high spatial and quantitative agreement with manual measurements enabling its use in longitudinal studies.},

@article{He:2020aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE: Hyperpolarized 129Xe ventilation MRI is typically acquired using multislice fast gradient recalled echo (GRE), but interleaved 3D radial 129Xe gas transfer MRI now provides dissolved-phase and ventilation images from a single breath. To investigate whether these ventilation images provide equivalent quantitative metrics, we introduce generalized linear binning analysis.
METHODS: This study included 36 patients who had undergone both multislice GRE ventilation and 3D radial gas exchange imaging. Images were then quantified by linear binning to classify voxels into one of four clusters: ventilation defect percentage (VDP), Low-, Medium- or High-ventilation percentage (LVP, MVP, HVP). For 3D radial images, linear binning thresholds were generalized using a Box-Cox rescaled reference histogram. We compared the cluster populations from the two ventilation acquisitions both numerically and spatially.
RESULTS: Interacquisition Bland-Altman limits of agreement for the clusters between 3D radial vs GRE were (-7% to 5%) for VDP, (-10% to 14%) for LVP, and (-8% to 8%) for HVP. While binning maps were qualitatively similar between acquisitions, their spatial overlap was modest for VDP (Dice = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.2), and relatively poor for LVP (0.3 $\pm$ 0.1) and HVP (0.2 $\pm$ 0.1).
CONCLUSION: Both acquisitions yield reasonably concordant VDP and qualitatively similar maps. However, poor regional agreement (Dice) suggests that the two acquisitions cannot yet be used interchangeably. However, further improvements in 3D radial resolution and reconciliation of bias field correction may well obviate the need for a dedicated ventilation scan in many cases.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Ventilation heterogeneity is impossible to detect with spirometry. Alternatively, pulmonary ventilation can be imaged three-dimensionally using inhaled 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To date, such images have been quantified primarily based on ventilation defects. Here, we introduce a robust means to transform 129Xe MRI scans such that the underlying ventilation distribution and its heterogeneity can be quantified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative 129Xe ventilation MRI was conducted in 12 younger (24.7 $\pm$ 5.2 years) and 10 older (62.2 $\pm$ 7.2 years) healthy individuals, as well as in 9 younger (25.9 $\pm$ 6.4 yrs) and 10 older (63.2 $\pm$ 6.1 years) asthmatics. The younger healthy population was used to establish a reference ventilation distribution and thresholds for six intensity bins. These bins were used to display and quantify the ventilation defect region (VDR), the low ventilation region (LVR), and the high ventilation region (HVR).
RESULTS: The ventilation distribution in young subjects was roughly Gaussian with a mean and standard deviation of 0.52 $\pm$ 0.18, resulting in VDR = 2.1 $\pm$ 1.3%, LVR = 15.6 $\pm$ 5.4%, and HVR = 17.4 $\pm$ 3.1%. Older healthy volunteers exhibited a significantly right-skewed distribution (0.46 $\pm$ 0.20, P = 0.034), resulting in significantly increased VDR (7.0 $\pm$ 4.8%, P = 0.008) and LVR (24.5 $\pm$ 11.5%, P = 0.025). In the asthmatics, VDR and LVR increased in the older population, and HVR was significantly reduced (13.5 $\pm$ 4.6% vs 18.9 $\pm$ 4.5%, P = 0.009). Quantitative 129Xe MRI also revealed altered ventilation heterogeneity in response to albuterol in two asthmatics with normal spirometry.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 129Xe MRI provides a robust and objective means to display and quantify the pulmonary ventilation distribution, even in subjects who have airway function impairment not appreciated by spirometry.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To use a combination of helium-3 (3-He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton single-shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) to compare ventilated lung volumes in groups of "healthy" smokers, smokers diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and never-smokers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All study participants were assessed with spirometry prior to imaging. 3-He images were collected during an arrested breath hold, after inhaling a mixture of 200 mL of hyperpolarized 3-He/800 mL of N2. Proton SSFSE images were acquired after inhaling 1 liter of room air. The ventilated volume for each study participant was calculated from the 3-He images, and a ratio was calculated to give a percentage ventilated lung volume.
RESULTS: Never-smokers exhibited a 90% mean ventilated volume. The mean ventilated lung volumes for healthy smokers and smokers diagnosed with COPD were 75.2% and 67.6%, respectively. No correlation with spirometry was demonstrated for either of the smoking groups.
CONCLUSION: Combined 3-He/Proton SSFSE MRI of the lungs is a noninvasive method, using nonionizing radiation, which demonstrates ventilated airspaces and enables the calculation of ventilated lung volumes. This method appears to be sensitive to early obstructive changes in the lungs of smokers.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the 3He MRI findings of normal pulmonary ventilation in healthy volunteers and to evaluate abnormalities in patients with different lung diseases. Hyperpolarized 3He gas (300 ml, 3 x 10(5) Pa, polarized to 35-45% by optical pumping, provided in special glass cells) was inhaled by 8 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with different lung diseases. Imaging was performed with a three-dimensional fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence (TR = 11.8 msec; TE = 5 msec; transmitter amplitude, 5-8 V; corresponding flip angle, < 5 degrees) in a single breath-hold (22-42 seconds). Clinical and radiological examinations were available for correlation. The studies were performed successfully in eight of eight volunteers and in 8 of 10 patients. The lung parenchyma of volunteers with normal ventilatory function exhibited rather homogeneous intermediate to high signal, whereas patients with chronic obstructive lung disease or bronchiectasis presented with severe signal inhomogeneities with patchy or wedge-shaped defects. The mass effect of bronchogenic carcinoma, chronic empyema, lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion caused large signal defects, representing the lesion and adjacent hypoventilation, the extent of which had not been presumed from chest x-ray or CT. 3He MRI is a promising new modality for the assessment of pulmonary ventilation and its abnormalities. Additional studies are needed to determine its potential clinical role.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet-a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively.
RESULTS: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 $\pm$ 0.03, right lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02, right lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01), processing time is <1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.
CONCLUSION: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

In this work, we review the various state-of-the-art approaches to learning and prediction and/or optimizing image transformations using convolutional neural networks.

Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in this particular subfield which has been presented in various research venues.

	abstract = {While it is nearly effortless for humans to quickly assess the perceptual similarity between two images, the underlying processes are thought to be quite complex. Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called "perceptual losses"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive value of imaging and clinical and physiological measurements of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) in patients monitored for more than 5 years for pulmonary exacerbations that required hospitalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were monitored over 5 years in 91 subjects who provided written informed consent. Study was local research ethics board and Health Canada approved and HIPAA compliant. Subjects with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) wall area and relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ( RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ), helium 3 ((3)He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging ventilation defect percentage ( VDP ventilation defect percentage ), and apparent diffusion coefficient were generated. Zero-inflated Poisson model was used to compare number of hospitalizations with lung function and imaging measurements.
RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were hospitalized 58 times and had significantly worse forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .02), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P < .0001) than values in 67 subjects who were not hospitalized. In mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nine hospitalized subjects had significantly worse FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = .02) and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .02) than values in 52 subjects who were not hospitalized. (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was quantitatively related to CT airway morphology (r = 0.26, P = .01) and quantitatively (r = 0.61, P < .0001) and spatially related to emphysema; this spatial relationship was significantly greater for hospitalized patients with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than unhospitalized patients (P = .0006). For all subjects, number of prior hospitalizations (P < .0001), 6-minute walk test distance (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .03), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .002) were significantly related to number of hospitalizations. For 61 subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , only (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was significantly associated with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (P = .01).
CONCLUSION: (3)He MR imaging VDP ventilation defect percentage represents a mixed airways-emphysema phenotype and helps identify subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk for exacerbation that requires hospitalization.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for
	quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized
	helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing
	pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and
	expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed
	using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces.
	Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung
	produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces.
	Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding
	strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic
	analysis was performed on three volunteers. RESULTS: Tag lines in
	inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous
	3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains
	were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior
	portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant
	direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
	CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged
	(3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering
	techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits
	from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation
	of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

@article{Zhang:2001aa,
	abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe) diffusion MR can detect the expected enlargement of alveoli that occurs with lung growth during childhood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 29 normal subjects aged four to 30 years underwent HHe diffusion MR imaging with the b-value pair 0, 1.6 second/cm(2). A second acquisition during a separate breathhold was performed using the b-value pair 0, 4 second/cm(2) to evaluate the dependence on b-value. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and lung volume for each acquisition and each subject was determined.
RESULTS: Subjects as young as four years of age were able to cooperate with the imaging procedure. The mean ADC increased with increasing subject age (r = 0.8; P < 0.001), with a 55% increase in mean ADC from the youngest to oldest subject. Lung volumes measured on MR were highly repeatable for the two HHe MR acquisitions (r = 0.980, P < 0.001). The mean ADC values measured with the two different b-value pairs were highly correlated (r = 0.975; P < 0.001), but the higher b-value pair resulted in slightly lower mean ADCs (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: HHe diffusion MR appears to detect the expected increase in alveolar size during childhood, and thus HHe MR may be a noninvasive method to assess development of the lung microstructure.},

	abstract = {Despite a myriad of technical advances in medical imaging, as well as the growing need to address the global impact of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on health and quality of life, it remains challenging to obtain in vivo regional depiction and quantification of the most basic physiological functions of the lung-gas delivery to the airspaces and gas uptake by the lung parenchyma and blood-in a manner suitable for routine application in humans. We report a method based on MRI of hyperpolarized xenon-129 that permits simultaneous observation of the 3D distributions of ventilation (gas delivery) and gas uptake, as well as quantification of regional gas uptake based on the associated ventilation. Subjects with lung disease showed variations in gas uptake that differed from those in ventilation in many regions, suggesting that gas uptake as measured by this technique reflects such features as underlying pathological alterations of lung tissue or of local blood flow. Furthermore, the ratio of the signal associated with gas uptake to that associated with ventilation was substantially altered in subjects with lung disease compared with healthy subjects. This MRI-based method provides a way to quantify relationships among gas delivery, exchange, and transport, and appears to have significant potential to provide more insight into lung disease.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and test a method to noninvasively assess the functional lung microstructure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Multiple exchange time Xenon polarization Transfer Contrast technique (MXTC) encodes xenon gas-exchange contrast at multiple delay times permitting two lung-function parameters to be derived: (i) MXTC-F, the long exchange-time depolarization value, which is proportional to the tissue to alveolar-volume ratio and (ii) MXTC-S, the square root of the xenon exchange-time constant, which characterizes thickness and composition of alveolar septa. Three healthy volunteers, one asthmatic, and two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (GOLD stage I and II) subjects were imaged with MXTC MRI. In a subset of subjects, hyperpolarized xenon-129 ADC MRI and CT imaging were also performed.
RESULTS: The MXTC-S parameter was found to be elevated in subjects with lung disease (P-value = 0.018). In the MXTC-F parameter map it was feasible to identify regional loss of functional tissue in a COPD patient. MXTC-F maps showed excellent regional correlation with CT and ADC (P ≥ 0.90) in one COPD subject.
CONCLUSION: The functional tissue-density parameter MXTC-F showed regional agreement with other imaging techniques. The newly developed parameter MXTC-S, which characterizes the functional thickness of alveolar septa, has potential as a novel biomarker for regional parenchymal inflammation or thickening.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether measurement of the relative area of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than a certain threshold on thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained during expiration is a valuable method of quantifying the extent of pulmonary emphysema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients underwent CT (with 1-mm collimation) preoperatively during inspiration and expiration. Relative areas of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than various thresholds were calculated. These relative areas were compared with areas found macroscopically to have emphysema (59 patients [51 men, eight women; aged 40-77 years]) and with two microscopic indices (35 patients [29 men, six women; aged 42-77 years]) assessed on the resected specimens.
RESULTS: The valid expiratory CT thresholds were found to be -820 and 910 HU for microscopic and macroscopic emphysema, respectively. However, results of stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the inspiratory threshold of -950 HU was superior for both macroscopically and microscopically quantified emphysema. The correlation coefficients in expiratory CT were higher for the pulmonary volumes but similar for the diffusing capacity.
CONCLUSION: Expiratory quantitative CT is not as accurate as inspiratory CT for quantifying pulmonary emphysema and probably reflects air trapping more than reduction in the alveolar wall surface.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary x-ray computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research and development has been motivated, in part, by the quest to subphenotype common chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For thoracic CT and MRI, the main COPD research tools, disease biomarkers are being validated that go beyond anatomy and structure to include pulmonary functional measurements such as regional ventilation, perfusion, and inflammation. In addition, there has also been a drive to improve spatial and contrast resolution while at the same time reducing or eliminating radiation exposure. Therefore, this review focuses on our evolving understanding of patient-relevant and clinically important COPD endpoints and how current and emerging MRI and CT tools and measurements may be exploited for their identification, quantification, and utilization. Since reviews of the imaging physics of pulmonary CT and MRI and reviews of other COPD imaging methods were previously published and well-summarized, we focus on the current clinical challenges in COPD and the potential of newly emerging MR and CT imaging measurements to address them. Here we summarize MRI and CT imaging methods and their clinical translation for generating reproducible and sensitive measurements of COPD related to pulmonary ventilation and perfusion as well as parenchyma morphology. The key clinical problems in COPD provide an important framework in which pulmonary imaging needs to rapidly move in order to address the staggering burden, costs, as well as the mortality and morbidity associated with COPD.

The method has the advantage that it can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue model is available. Described as nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities.

@article{Samee:2003aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging of gas distribution in the lungs of patients with asthma has been restricted because of the lack of a suitable gaseous contrast agent. Hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe3) provides a new technique for magnetic resonance imaging of lung diseases.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the use of HHe3 gas to image the lungs of patients with moderate or severe asthma and to assess changes in gas distribution after methacholine and exercise challenge.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in asthmatic patients immediately after inhalation of HHe3 gas. In addition, images were obtained before and after methacholine challenge and a standard exercise test.
RESULTS: Areas of the lung with no signal or sharply reduced HHe3 signal (ventilation defects) are common in patients with asthma, and the number of defects was inversely related to the percent predicted FEV(1) (r = 0.71, P <.002). After methacholine challenge (n = 3), the number of defects increased. Similarly, imaging of the lungs after exercise (n = 6) showed increased ventilation defects in parallel with decreases in FEV(1). The increase in defects after challenge in these 9 asthmatic patients was significant both for the number (P <.02) and extent (P <.02) of the defects. The variability and speed of changes in ventilation and the complete lack of signal in many areas is in keeping with a model in which the defects result from airway closure.
CONCLUSION: HHe3 magnetic resonance provides a new technique for imaging the distribution of inhaled air in the lungs. The technique is suitable for following responses to treatment of asthma and changes after methacholine or exercise challenge.},

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hyperpolarized 3He magnetic resonance imaging (3He MRI) at 3.0 Tesla of healthy volunteers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients was performed for quantitative evaluation of ventilation defects and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and for comparison to published results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. The reproducibility of 3He ADC and ventilation defects was also assessed in subjects scanned 3 times, twice within 10 minutes, and again within 7 +/- 2 days of the first MRI visit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperpolarized 3He MRI was performed in 6 subjects. Two interleaved images with and without additional diffusion sensitization were acquired with the first image serving as a ventilation image from which defect score and volume were measured and the combination of the 2 images used to compute ADC maps and ADC histograms.
RESULTS: He MRI at 3.0 Tesla showed increased mean ADC and ADC standard deviation for subjects with COPD compared with healthy volunteers (ADC healthy volunteer (0.24 +/- 0.12 cm2/s), mild-moderate COPD (0.34 +/- 0.14 cm2/s), and severe COPD (0.47 +/- 0.21 cm2/s), and these values were similar to previously reported results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. Reproducibility of mean ADC was high (coefficient of variation 2% in severe COPD, 3% in mild-moderate COPD, 4% in healthy volunteers) across all 3 scans. Higher same-day scan reproducibility was observed for ventilation defect volume compared with 1-week scan reproducibility in this small group of subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: ADC values for emphysematous lungs were significantly increased compared with healthy lungs in age-matched subjects, and all values were comparable to those reported previously at 1.5 Tesla. Ventilation defect score and ventilation defect volume results were also comparable to results previously reported in COPD subjects Reproducibility of ADC for same-day scan-rescan and 7-day rescan was high and similar to previously reported results.},

	abstract = {With advances in multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), it is now possible to image the lung in 10 s or less and accurately extract the lungs, lobes, and airway tree to the fifth- through seventh-generation bronchi and to regionally characterize lung density, texture, ventilation, and perfusion. These methods are now being used to phenotype the lung in health and disease and to gain insights into the etiology of pathologic processes. This article outlines the application of these methodologies with specific emphasis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We demonstrate the use of our methods for assessing regional ventilation and perfusion and demonstrate early data that show, in a sheep model, a regionally intact hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor (HPV) response with an apparent inhibition of HPV regionally in the presence of inflammation. We present the hypothesis that, in subjects with pulmonary emphysema, one major contributing factor leading to parenchymal destruction is the lack of a regional blunting of HPV when the regional hypoxia is related to regional inflammatory events (bronchiolitis or alveolar flooding). If maintaining adequate blood flow to inflamed lung regions is critical to the nondestructive resolution of inflammatory events, the pathologic condition whereby HPV is sustained in regions of inflammation would likely have its greatest effect in the lung apices where blood flow is already reduced in the upright body posture.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether focal changes of airflow obstruction within the lungs of patients with asthma vary or are fixed in location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction. With hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance (H(3)HeMR) imaging, the airspaces are depicted and focal areas of airflow obstruction are shown as "ventilation defects."
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regional changes of airflow obstruction with time and repeated bronchoconstriction.
METHODS: H(3)HeMR and spirometry were performed before (pre) and immediately after (post) methacholine challenge in 10 young patients with asthma on 2 days that were 7-476 days (mean, 185.3 +/- 37.2 days) apart. Pair-wise image comparisons were performed to determine the change in location of ventilation defects within the lung and their change in size.
RESULTS: When comparing premethacholine versus premethacholine and postmethacholine versus post-methacholine images of the 2 days, 41% +/- 10% and 69% +/- 5% (P = .017) of defects, respectively, were in the same location, and of those, 69% +/- 12% and 43% +/- 5% (P = .022), respectively, did not change size. Comparing premethacholine versus postmethacholine images, 58% +/- 9% of defects were in the same location on day 1 and 73% +/- 7% (P = .088) on day 2. On both days, the percent increase in defect number from premethacholine to postmethacholine was much greater than the percent decrease in spirometric values (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Many of the ventilation defects persisted or recurred in the same location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction, suggesting that the regional changes of airflow obstruction are relatively fixed within the lung.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings give new insight into the regional airflow variability within the lungs of patients with asthma.},

@article{Lange:2006aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate characterization of asthma severity is difficult due to the variability of symptoms. Hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI (H(3)HeMR) is a new technique in which the airspaces are visualized, depicting regions with airflow obstruction as "ventilation defects." The objective of this study was to compare the extent of H(3)HeMR ventilation defects with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.
METHODS: Patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma and normal control subjects underwent H(3)HeMR. For each person, the number and size of ventilation defects were scored and the average number of ventilation defects per slice (VDS) was calculated. The correlations of the imaging findings with measures of asthma severity and spirometry were determined.
RESULTS: There were 58 patients with asthma (mild-intermittent, n = 13; mild-persistent, n = 13; moderate-persistent, n = 20; and severe-persistent, n = 12) and 18 control subjects. Mean +/- SE VDS for asthmatics was significantly greater than for control subjects (0.99 +/- 0.15 vs 0.26 +/- 0.22, p = 0.004). Among asthmatics, VDS was significantly higher for the group with moderate-persistent and severe-persistent disease than for the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (1.37 +/- 0.24 vs 0.53 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001). VDS correlated significantly with FEV(1)/FVC (r = - 0.51, p = 0.002), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% from the beginning of FVC (FEF(25-75%)) percentage of predicted for height, sex, and race (%predicted) [r = - 0.50, p = 0.001], and FEV(1) %predicted (r = - 0.40, p = 0.002), but not with FVC %predicted (r = - 0.26, p = 0.057) and peak expiratory flow %predicted (r = - 0.16, p = 0.231). Many asthmatics had an elevated VDS, but their spirometric indexes, except FEF(25%-75%), were normal. Most ventilation defects were < 3 cm in size for all asthmatics. In the group of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, there were more defects > or =3 cm than in the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (p = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Regional changes of airflow obstruction in asthmatics depicted by H(3)HeMR correlate with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.},

@article{Coxson:2005aa,
	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex genetic disorder in which environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke, interact with genetic susceptibility to cause disease. Airway obstruction in COPD is due to an exaggerated inflammatory response that ultimately destroys the lung parenchyma (emphysema) and increases airway resistance by remodeling the airway wall. Until recently, assessment of these disease processes required the examination of resected tissue. However, computed tomography (CT) now allows researchers to measure the structure of the lung parenchyma and airway wall without having to remove the tissue. This review describes some of the new CT techniques for quantitative assessment of lung structure. These techniques are extremely important to study the pathogenesis of COPD as well as differentiate patients with predominantly emphysema disease from those with airway wall remodeling, and to assess the effects of therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Asthma is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation and reversible obstruction of the small airways resulting in impaired pulmonary ventilation. Hyperpolarized 3He magnetic resonance (MR) lung imaging is a new technology that provides a detailed image of lung ventilation. Hyperpolarized 3He lung imaging was performed in 10 asthmatics and 10 healthy subjects. Seven asthmatics had ventilation defects distributed throughout the lungs compared with none of the normal subjects. These ventilation defects were more numerous and larger in the two symptomatic asthmatics who had abnormal spirometry. Ventilation defects studied over time demonstrated no change in appearance over 30-60 minutes. One asthmatic subject was studied twice in a three-week period and had ventilation defects which resolved and appeared in that time. This same subject was studied before and after bronchodilator therapy, and all ventilation defects resolved after therapy. Hyperpolarized 3He lung imaging can detect the small, reversible ventilation defects that characterize asthma. The ability to visualize lung ventilation offers a direct method of assessing asthmatics and their response to therapy.},

@article{Teague:2014aa,
	abstract = {Non-uniform distribution of inspired gas within the lung, termed ventilation heterogeneity, is present in patients with even mild asthma. Current evidence strongly supports ventilation heterogeneity as a fundamental derangement of lung function in asthma that contributes per se to hypoxemia and airway hyper-responsiveness. An extreme example of ventilation heterogeneity is the identification by hyperpolarized gas MRI of lung regions with no ventilation, termed filling defects. Lung filling defects in patients with asthma can persist over time, increase in size with methacholine-induced bronchospasm and more likely are caused by obstruction of the peripheral and not the proximal airways. Ventilation heterogeneity can be quantified in the conducting and acinar lung zones with the multiple gas washout method, and in the acinar zone does not fully resolve following bronchodilator treatment in patients with asthma. In prospective studies, the degree of ventilation heterogeneity at baseline predicts airway hyper-responsiveness and response to corticosteroid dose titration. An important unanswered question is the relationship of airways inflammation to ventilation heterogeneity. In consideration of the importance of ventilation heterogeneity in its pathobiology, asthma is more a focal disorder with regional pathology akin to regional ileitis and not the generalized disorder of the airways as it has been viewed in the past.},

Given the superb performance of N3 and its public availability, it has been the subject of several evaluation studies. These studies have demonstrated the importance of certain parameters associated with the B-spline least-squares fitting. We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modified hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias field correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as "N4ITK," available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment is demonstrated using simulated data from the publicly available Brainweb database, hyperpolarized (3)He lung image data, and 9.4T postmortem hippocampus data.},

This computational framework was applied to a study consisting of 55 subjects (47 asthmatic and eight normal). Each subject was imaged before and after respiratory challenge and also underwent spirometry. Approximately 1600 image features were calculated from the lungs in each image. Both the image and 27 spirometric features were ranked based on their ability to characterize clinical diagnosis using a mutual information-based feature subset selection algorithm. It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually. Interestingly, it was also found that spirometric values are relatively orthogonal to these image feature values in terms of informational content.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces. Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces. Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic analysis was performed on three volunteers.
RESULTS: Tag lines in inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous 3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged (3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

Current approaches to diagnosis and treatment assessment of lung disease commonly rely on pulmonary function testing. Such testing is limited to global measures of lung function, neglecting regional measurements, which are critical for early diagnosis and localization of disease. Increased accessibility to medical image acquisition strategies with high spatiotemporal resolution coupled with the development of sophisticated intensity-based and geometric registration techniques has resulted in the recent exploration of modeling pulmonary motion for calculating local measures of deformation. In this review, the authors provide a broad overview of such research efforts for the estimation of pulmonary deformation.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},
