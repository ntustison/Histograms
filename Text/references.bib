	abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems produce spatial distribution estimates of proton density, relaxation time, and flow, in a two dimensional matrix form that is analogous to that of the image data obtained from multispectral imaging satellites. Advanced NASA satellite image processing offers sophisticated multispectral analysis of MR images. Spin echo and inversion recovery pulse sequence images were entered in a digital format compatible with satellite images and accurately registered pixel by pixel. Signatures of each tissue class were automatically determined using both supervised and unsupervised classification. Overall tissue classification was obtained in the form of a theme map. In MR images of the brain, for example, the classes included CSF, gray matter, white matter, subcutaneous fat, muscle, and bone. These methods provide an efficient means of identifying subtle relationships in a multi-image MR study.},

@article{Shammi:2021aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: In this study, we compared hyperpolarized 3He and 129Xe images from patients with cystic fibrosis using two commonly applied magnetic resonance sequences, standard gradient echo (GRE) and balanced steady-state free precession (TrueFISP) to quantify regional similarities and differences in signal distribution and defect analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients (7M/3F) with cystic fibrosis underwent hyperpolarized gas MR imaging with both 3He and 129Xe. Six had MRI with both GRE, and TrueFISP sequences and four patients had only GRE sequence but not TrueFISP. Ventilation defect percentages (VDPs) were calculated as lung voxels with <60% of the whole-lung hyperpolarized gas signal mean and was measured in all datasets. The voxel signal distributions of both 129Xe and 3He gases were visualized and compared using violin plots. VDPs of hyperpolarized 3 He and 129 Xe were compared in Bland-Altman plots; Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships between inter-gas and inter-scan to assess the reproducibility.
RESULTS: A significant correlation was demonstrated between 129Xe VDP and 3He VDP for both GRE and TrueFISP sequences (ρ = 0.78, p<0.0004). The correlation between the GRE and TrueFISP VDP for 3He was ρ = 0.98 and was ρ = 0.91 for 129Xe. Overall, 129Xe (27.2$\pm$9.4) VDP was higher than 3He (24.3$\pm$6.9) VDP on average on cystic fibrosis patients.
CONCLUSION: In patients with cystic fibrosis, the selection of hyperpolarized 129Xe or 3He gas is most likely inconsequential when it comes to measure the overall lung function by VDP although 129Xe may be more sensitive to starker lung defects, particularly when using a TrueFISP sequence.},

Low signal intensities (SNR < 2) are therefore biased due to the noise. It is shown how the underlying noise can be estimated from the images and a simple correction scheme is provided to reduce the bias. The noise characteristics in phase images are also studied and shown to be very different from those of the magnitude images. Common to both,however, is that the noise distributions are nearly Gaussian for SNR larger than two.},

@article{Avants:2011aa,
	abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

@article{Collewet:2004aa,
	abstract = {Texture analysis methods quantify the spatial variations in gray level values within an image and thus can provide useful information on the structures observed. However, they are sensitive to acquisition conditions due to the use of different protocols and to intra- and interscanner variations in the case of MRI. The influence was studied of two protocols and four different conditions of normalization of gray levels on the discrimination power of texture analysis methods applied to soft cheeses. Thirty-two samples of soft cheese were chosen at two different ripening periods (16 young and 16 old samples) in order to obtain two different microscopic structures of the protein gel. Proton density and T(2)-weighted MR images were acquired using a spin echo sequence on a 0.2 T scanner. Gray levels were normalized according to four methods: original gray levels, same maximum for all images, same mean for all images, and dynamics limited to micro +/- 3sigma. Regions of interest were automatically defined, and texture descriptors were then computed for the co-occurrence matrix, run length matrix, gradient matrix, autoregressive model, and wavelet transform. The features with the lowest probability of error and average correlation coefficient were selected and used for classification with 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) classifier. The best results were obtained when using the limitation of dynamics to micro +/- 3sigma, which enhanced the differences between the two classes. The results demonstrated the influence of the normalization method and of the acquisition protocol on the effectiveness of the classification and also on the parameters selected for classification. These results indicate the need to evaluate sensitivity to MR acquisition protocols and to gray level normalization methods when texture analysis is required.},

The essential parts of this approach to automatic windowing are (1) avoidance of irrelevant pixels, (2) identification of the type of MR image from information stored in the image header, and (3) use of algorithms for the maximum and minimum values that reflect the preference of the intended viewer using a specific monitor and ambient lighting conditions for the different types of images. An evaluation in thirteen clinical studies yielded 91.5% (2312/2526) images requiring no further adjustment and the remaining 8.5% (214/2526) being improved by further adjustment.},

@article{De-Nunzio:2015aa,
	abstract = {The paper is focused on a tiSsue-Based Standardization Technique (SBST) of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. Magnetic Resonance Imaging intensities have no fixed tissue-specific numeric meaning, even within the same MRI protocol, for the same body region, or even for images of the same patient obtained on the same scanner in different moments. This affects postprocessing tasks such as automatic segmentation or unsupervised/supervised classification methods, which strictly depend on the observed image intensities, compromising the accuracy and efficiency of many image analyses algorithms. A large number of MR images from public databases, belonging to healthy people and to patients with different degrees of neurodegenerative pathology, were employed together with synthetic MRIs. Combining both histogram and tissue-specific intensity information, a correspondence is obtained for each tissue across images. The novelty consists of computing three standardizing transformations for the three main brain tissues, for each tissue class separately. In order to create a continuous intensity mapping, spline smoothing of the overall slightly discontinuous piecewise-linear intensity transformation is performed. The robustness of the technique is assessed in a post hoc manner, by verifying that automatic segmentation of images before and after standardization gives a high overlapping (Dice index >0.9) for each tissue class, even across images coming from different sources. Furthermore, SBST efficacy is tested by evaluating if and how much it increases intertissue discrimination and by assessing gaussianity of tissue gray-level distributions before and after standardization. Some quantitative comparisons to already existing different approaches available in the literature are performed. },

@article{Nyul:2000aa,
	abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the lack of a standard and quantifiable interpretation of image intensities. Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. We have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a way that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.},

A two-step postprocessing method is proposed for standardizing the intensity scale in such a way that for the same MR protocol and body region, similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. In the first step, the parameters of the standardizing transformation are "learned" from a set of images. In the second step, for each MR study these parameters are used to map their histogram into the standardized histogram. The method was tested quantitatively on 90 whole-brain studies of multiple sclerosis patients for several protocols and qualitatively for several other protocols and body regions. Measurements using mean squared difference showed that the standardized image intensities have statistically significantly (P < 0.01) more consistent range and meaning than the originals. Fixed gray level windows can be established for the standardized images and used for display without the need of per case adjustment. Preliminary results also indicate that the method facilitates improving the degree of automation of image segmentation. Magn Reson Med 42:1072-1081, 1999.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To improve intra- and interobserver variability and enable the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for multicenter, multiobserver studies, we generated a semiautomated segmentation method for hyperpolarized helium-3 ((3)He) MRI. Therefore the objective of this study was to compare the reproducibility and spatial agreement of manual and semiautomated segmentation of (3)He MRI ventilation defect volume (VDV) and ventilation volume (VV) in subjects with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The multistep semiautomated segmentation method we developed employed hierarchical K-means clustering to classify (3)He MRI pixel intensity values into five user-determined clusters ranging from signal void to hyperintense. A seeded region-growing algorithm was also used to segment the (1)H MRI thoracic cavity for coregistration to the (3)He cluster-map, generating VDV and VV.
RESULTS: We compared manual segmentation performed by an expert observer and semiautomated measurements of (3)He MRI VDV and observed strong significant correlations between the volumes generated using each method (asthma, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001; COPD, n = 5, r = 0.84, P < .0001; CF, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001). Semiautomated VDV had high interobserver reproducibility (coefficient of variation [CV] = 7%, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96); intraobserver reproducibility was significantly higher for semiautomated (CV = 5%, ICC = 1.00) compared to manual VDV (CV = 12%, ICC = 0.98). Spatial agreement for VV determined using the Dice coefficient (D) was also high for all disease states (asthma, D = 0.95; COPD, D = 0.88; CF, D = 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated segmentation (3)He MRI provides excellent inter- and intraobserver precision with high spatial and quantitative agreement with manual measurements enabling its use in longitudinal studies.},

@article{He:2020aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE: Hyperpolarized 129Xe ventilation MRI is typically acquired using multislice fast gradient recalled echo (GRE), but interleaved 3D radial 129Xe gas transfer MRI now provides dissolved-phase and ventilation images from a single breath. To investigate whether these ventilation images provide equivalent quantitative metrics, we introduce generalized linear binning analysis.
METHODS: This study included 36 patients who had undergone both multislice GRE ventilation and 3D radial gas exchange imaging. Images were then quantified by linear binning to classify voxels into one of four clusters: ventilation defect percentage (VDP), Low-, Medium- or High-ventilation percentage (LVP, MVP, HVP). For 3D radial images, linear binning thresholds were generalized using a Box-Cox rescaled reference histogram. We compared the cluster populations from the two ventilation acquisitions both numerically and spatially.
RESULTS: Interacquisition Bland-Altman limits of agreement for the clusters between 3D radial vs GRE were (-7% to 5%) for VDP, (-10% to 14%) for LVP, and (-8% to 8%) for HVP. While binning maps were qualitatively similar between acquisitions, their spatial overlap was modest for VDP (Dice = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.2), and relatively poor for LVP (0.3 $\pm$ 0.1) and HVP (0.2 $\pm$ 0.1).
CONCLUSION: Both acquisitions yield reasonably concordant VDP and qualitatively similar maps. However, poor regional agreement (Dice) suggests that the two acquisitions cannot yet be used interchangeably. However, further improvements in 3D radial resolution and reconciliation of bias field correction may well obviate the need for a dedicated ventilation scan in many cases.},

@article{He:2016aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Ventilation heterogeneity is impossible to detect with spirometry. Alternatively, pulmonary ventilation can be imaged three-dimensionally using inhaled 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To date, such images have been quantified primarily based on ventilation defects. Here, we introduce a robust means to transform 129Xe MRI scans such that the underlying ventilation distribution and its heterogeneity can be quantified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative 129Xe ventilation MRI was conducted in 12 younger (24.7 $\pm$ 5.2 years) and 10 older (62.2 $\pm$ 7.2 years) healthy individuals, as well as in 9 younger (25.9 $\pm$ 6.4 yrs) and 10 older (63.2 $\pm$ 6.1 years) asthmatics. The younger healthy population was used to establish a reference ventilation distribution and thresholds for six intensity bins. These bins were used to display and quantify the ventilation defect region (VDR), the low ventilation region (LVR), and the high ventilation region (HVR).
RESULTS: The ventilation distribution in young subjects was roughly Gaussian with a mean and standard deviation of 0.52 $\pm$ 0.18, resulting in VDR = 2.1 $\pm$ 1.3%, LVR = 15.6 $\pm$ 5.4%, and HVR = 17.4 $\pm$ 3.1%. Older healthy volunteers exhibited a significantly right-skewed distribution (0.46 $\pm$ 0.20, P = 0.034), resulting in significantly increased VDR (7.0 $\pm$ 4.8%, P = 0.008) and LVR (24.5 $\pm$ 11.5%, P = 0.025). In the asthmatics, VDR and LVR increased in the older population, and HVR was significantly reduced (13.5 $\pm$ 4.6% vs 18.9 $\pm$ 4.5%, P = 0.009). Quantitative 129Xe MRI also revealed altered ventilation heterogeneity in response to albuterol in two asthmatics with normal spirometry.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative 129Xe MRI provides a robust and objective means to display and quantify the pulmonary ventilation distribution, even in subjects who have airway function impairment not appreciated by spirometry.},

@article{Woodhouse:2005aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To use a combination of helium-3 (3-He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton single-shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) to compare ventilated lung volumes in groups of "healthy" smokers, smokers diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and never-smokers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All study participants were assessed with spirometry prior to imaging. 3-He images were collected during an arrested breath hold, after inhaling a mixture of 200 mL of hyperpolarized 3-He/800 mL of N2. Proton SSFSE images were acquired after inhaling 1 liter of room air. The ventilated volume for each study participant was calculated from the 3-He images, and a ratio was calculated to give a percentage ventilated lung volume.
RESULTS: Never-smokers exhibited a 90% mean ventilated volume. The mean ventilated lung volumes for healthy smokers and smokers diagnosed with COPD were 75.2% and 67.6%, respectively. No correlation with spirometry was demonstrated for either of the smoking groups.
CONCLUSION: Combined 3-He/Proton SSFSE MRI of the lungs is a noninvasive method, using nonionizing radiation, which demonstrates ventilated airspaces and enables the calculation of ventilated lung volumes. This method appears to be sensitive to early obstructive changes in the lungs of smokers.},

Direct optical pumping of metastable 3He atoms has been shown to produce enormous polarization on the order of 0.4-0.6. This is about 10(5) times larger than the polarization of water protons at thermal equilibrium used in conventional MRI. We demonstrate that hyperpolarized 3He gas can be applied to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of organs with air-filled spaces in humans. In vivo 3He MR experiments were performed in a whole-body MR scanner with a superconducting magnet ramped down to 0.8 T. Anatomical details of the upper respiratory tract and of the lungs of a volunteer were visualized with the FLASH technique demonstrating the potential of the method for fast imaging of airways in the human body and for pulmonary ventilation studies.},

Hyperpolarized 3He gas (300 ml, 3 x 10(5) Pa, polarized to 35-45% by optical pumping, provided in special glass cells) was inhaled by 8 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with different lung diseases. Imaging was performed with a three-dimensional fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence (TR = 11.8 msec; TE = 5 msec; transmitter amplitude, 5-8 V; corresponding flip angle, < 5 degrees) in a single breath-hold (22-42 seconds). Clinical and radiological examinations were available for correlation. The studies were performed successfully in eight of eight volunteers and in 8 of 10 patients. The lung parenchyma of volunteers with normal ventilatory function exhibited rather homogeneous intermediate to high signal, whereas patients with chronic obstructive lung disease or bronchiectasis presented with severe signal inhomogeneities with patchy or wedge-shaped defects. The mass effect of bronchogenic carcinoma, chronic empyema, lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion caused large signal defects, representing the lesion and adjacent hypoventilation, the extent of which had not been presumed from chest x-ray or CT. 3He MRI is a promising new modality for the assessment of pulmonary ventilation and its abnormalities. Additional studies are needed to determine its potential clinical role.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet-a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively.
RESULTS: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 $\pm$ 0.03, right lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02, right lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01), processing time is <1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.
CONCLUSION: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

In this work, we review the various state-of-the-art approaches to learning and prediction and/or optimizing image transformations using convolutional neural networks.

Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in this particular subfield which has been presented in various research venues. We contextualize these contributions within the broader scope of deep learning advancements and, in so doing, attempt to facilitate the leveraging and further development of such techniques within the medical imaging research community.},

	abstract = {While it is nearly effortless for humans to quickly assess the perceptual similarity between two images, the underlying processes are thought to be quite complex. Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called "perceptual losses"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive value of imaging and clinical and physiological measurements of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) in patients monitored for more than 5 years for pulmonary exacerbations that required hospitalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were monitored over 5 years in 91 subjects who provided written informed consent. Study was local research ethics board and Health Canada approved and HIPAA compliant. Subjects with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) wall area and relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ( RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ), helium 3 ((3)He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging ventilation defect percentage ( VDP ventilation defect percentage ), and apparent diffusion coefficient were generated. Zero-inflated Poisson model was used to compare number of hospitalizations with lung function and imaging measurements.
RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were hospitalized 58 times and had significantly worse forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .02), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P < .0001) than values in 67 subjects who were not hospitalized. In mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nine hospitalized subjects had significantly worse FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = .02) and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .02) than values in 52 subjects who were not hospitalized. (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was quantitatively related to CT airway morphology (r = 0.26, P = .01) and quantitatively (r = 0.61, P < .0001) and spatially related to emphysema; this spatial relationship was significantly greater for hospitalized patients with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than unhospitalized patients (P = .0006). For all subjects, number of prior hospitalizations (P < .0001), 6-minute walk test distance (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .03), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .002) were significantly related to number of hospitalizations. For 61 subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , only (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was significantly associated with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (P = .01).
CONCLUSION: (3)He MR imaging VDP ventilation defect percentage represents a mixed airways-emphysema phenotype and helps identify subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk for exacerbation that requires hospitalization.},

By means of Markov random fields (MRF's) the segmentation algorithm captures three features that are of special importance for MR images, i.e., nonparametric distributions of tissue intensities, neighborhood correlations, and signal inhomogeneities. Detailed simulations and real MR images demonstrate the performance of the segmentation algorithm. In particular, the impact of noise, inhomogeneity, smoothing, and structure thickness are analyzed quantitatively. Even single-echo MR images are well classified into gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, scalp-bone, and background. A simulated annealing and an iterated conditional modes implementation are presented.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for
	quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized
	helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing
	pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and
	expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed
	using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces.
	Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung
	produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces.
	Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding
	strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic
	analysis was performed on three volunteers. RESULTS: Tag lines in
	inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous
	3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains
	were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior
	portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant
	direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
	CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged
	(3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering
	techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits
	from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation
	of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

@article{Zhang:2001aa,
	abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

@article{Altes:2006aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe) diffusion MR can detect the expected enlargement of alveoli that occurs with lung growth during childhood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 29 normal subjects aged four to 30 years underwent HHe diffusion MR imaging with the b-value pair 0, 1.6 second/cm(2). A second acquisition during a separate breathhold was performed using the b-value pair 0, 4 second/cm(2) to evaluate the dependence on b-value. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and lung volume for each acquisition and each subject was determined.
RESULTS: Subjects as young as four years of age were able to cooperate with the imaging procedure. The mean ADC increased with increasing subject age (r = 0.8; P < 0.001), with a 55% increase in mean ADC from the youngest to oldest subject. Lung volumes measured on MR were highly repeatable for the two HHe MR acquisitions (r = 0.980, P < 0.001). The mean ADC values measured with the two different b-value pairs were highly correlated (r = 0.975; P < 0.001), but the higher b-value pair resulted in slightly lower mean ADCs (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: HHe diffusion MR appears to detect the expected increase in alveolar size during childhood, and thus HHe MR may be a noninvasive method to assess development of the lung microstructure.},

	abstract = {Despite a myriad of technical advances in medical imaging, as well as the growing need to address the global impact of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on health and quality of life, it remains challenging to obtain in vivo regional depiction and quantification of the most basic physiological functions of the lung-gas delivery to the airspaces and gas uptake by the lung parenchyma and blood-in a manner suitable for routine application in humans. We report a method based on MRI of hyperpolarized xenon-129 that permits simultaneous observation of the 3D distributions of ventilation (gas delivery) and gas uptake, as well as quantification of regional gas uptake based on the associated ventilation. Subjects with lung disease showed variations in gas uptake that differed from those in ventilation in many regions, suggesting that gas uptake as measured by this technique reflects such features as underlying pathological alterations of lung tissue or of local blood flow. Furthermore, the ratio of the signal associated with gas uptake to that associated with ventilation was substantially altered in subjects with lung disease compared with healthy subjects. This MRI-based method provides a way to quantify relationships among gas delivery, exchange, and transport, and appears to have significant potential to provide more insight into lung disease.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and test a method to noninvasively assess the functional lung microstructure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Multiple exchange time Xenon polarization Transfer Contrast technique (MXTC) encodes xenon gas-exchange contrast at multiple delay times permitting two lung-function parameters to be derived: (i) MXTC-F, the long exchange-time depolarization value, which is proportional to the tissue to alveolar-volume ratio and (ii) MXTC-S, the square root of the xenon exchange-time constant, which characterizes thickness and composition of alveolar septa. Three healthy volunteers, one asthmatic, and two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (GOLD stage I and II) subjects were imaged with MXTC MRI. In a subset of subjects, hyperpolarized xenon-129 ADC MRI and CT imaging were also performed.
RESULTS: The MXTC-S parameter was found to be elevated in subjects with lung disease (P-value = 0.018). In the MXTC-F parameter map it was feasible to identify regional loss of functional tissue in a COPD patient. MXTC-F maps showed excellent regional correlation with CT and ADC (P ≥ 0.90) in one COPD subject.
CONCLUSION: The functional tissue-density parameter MXTC-F showed regional agreement with other imaging techniques. The newly developed parameter MXTC-S, which characterizes the functional thickness of alveolar septa, has potential as a novel biomarker for regional parenchymal inflammation or thickening.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether measurement of the relative area of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than a certain threshold on thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained during expiration is a valuable method of quantifying the extent of pulmonary emphysema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients underwent CT (with 1-mm collimation) preoperatively during inspiration and expiration. Relative areas of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than various thresholds were calculated. These relative areas were compared with areas found macroscopically to have emphysema (59 patients [51 men, eight women; aged 40-77 years]) and with two microscopic indices (35 patients [29 men, six women; aged 42-77 years]) assessed on the resected specimens.
RESULTS: The valid expiratory CT thresholds were found to be -820 and 910 HU for microscopic and macroscopic emphysema, respectively. However, results of stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the inspiratory threshold of -950 HU was superior for both macroscopically and microscopically quantified emphysema. The correlation coefficients in expiratory CT were higher for the pulmonary volumes but similar for the diffusing capacity.
CONCLUSION: Expiratory quantitative CT is not as accurate as inspiratory CT for quantifying pulmonary emphysema and probably reflects air trapping more than reduction in the alveolar wall surface.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary x-ray computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research and development has been motivated, in part, by the quest to subphenotype common chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For thoracic CT and MRI, the main COPD research tools, disease biomarkers are being validated that go beyond anatomy and structure to include pulmonary functional measurements such as regional ventilation, perfusion, and inflammation. In addition, there has also been a drive to improve spatial and contrast resolution while at the same time reducing or eliminating radiation exposure. Therefore, this review focuses on our evolving understanding of patient-relevant and clinically important COPD endpoints and how current and emerging MRI and CT tools and measurements may be exploited for their identification, quantification, and utilization. Since reviews of the imaging physics of pulmonary CT and MRI and reviews of other COPD imaging methods were previously published and well-summarized, we focus on the current clinical challenges in COPD and the potential of newly emerging MR and CT imaging measurements to address them. Here we summarize MRI and CT imaging methods and their clinical translation for generating reproducible and sensitive measurements of COPD related to pulmonary ventilation and perfusion as well as parenchyma morphology. The key clinical problems in COPD provide an important framework in which pulmonary imaging needs to rapidly move in order to address the staggering burden, costs, as well as the mortality and morbidity associated with COPD.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging of gas distribution in the lungs of patients with asthma has been restricted because of the lack of a suitable gaseous contrast agent. Hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe3) provides a new technique for magnetic resonance imaging of lung diseases.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the use of HHe3 gas to image the lungs of patients with moderate or severe asthma and to assess changes in gas distribution after methacholine and exercise challenge.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in asthmatic patients immediately after inhalation of HHe3 gas. In addition, images were obtained before and after methacholine challenge and a standard exercise test.
RESULTS: Areas of the lung with no signal or sharply reduced HHe3 signal (ventilation defects) are common in patients with asthma, and the number of defects was inversely related to the percent predicted FEV(1) (r = 0.71, P <.002). After methacholine challenge (n = 3), the number of defects increased. Similarly, imaging of the lungs after exercise (n = 6) showed increased ventilation defects in parallel with decreases in FEV(1). The increase in defects after challenge in these 9 asthmatic patients was significant both for the number (P <.02) and extent (P <.02) of the defects. The variability and speed of changes in ventilation and the complete lack of signal in many areas is in keeping with a model in which the defects result from airway closure.
CONCLUSION: HHe3 magnetic resonance provides a new technique for imaging the distribution of inhaled air in the lungs. The technique is suitable for following responses to treatment of asthma and changes after methacholine or exercise challenge.},

Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

Two interleaved images with and without additional diffusion sensitization were acquired with the first image serving as a ventilation image from which defect score and volume were measured and the combination of the 2 images used to compute ADC maps and ADC histograms.
RESULTS: He MRI at 3.0 Tesla showed increased mean ADC and ADC standard deviation for subjects with COPD compared with healthy volunteers (ADC healthy volunteer (0.24 +/- 0.12 cm2/s), mild-moderate COPD (0.34 +/- 0.14 cm2/s), and severe COPD (0.47 +/- 0.21 cm2/s), and these values were similar to previously reported results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. Reproducibility of mean ADC was high (coefficient of variation 2% in severe COPD, 3% in mild-moderate COPD, 4% in healthy volunteers) across all 3 scans. Higher same-day scan reproducibility was observed for ventilation defect volume compared with 1-week scan reproducibility in this small group of subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: ADC values for emphysematous lungs were significantly increased compared with healthy lungs in age-matched subjects, and all values were comparable to those reported previously at 1.5 Tesla. Ventilation defect score and ventilation defect volume results were also comparable to results previously reported in COPD subjects Reproducibility of ADC for same-day scan-rescan and 7-day rescan was high and similar to previously reported results.},

	abstract = {With advances in multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), it is now possible to image the lung in 10 s or less and accurately extract the lungs, lobes, and airway tree to the fifth- through seventh-generation bronchi and to regionally characterize lung density, texture, ventilation, and perfusion. These methods are now being used to phenotype the lung in health and disease and to gain insights into the etiology of pathologic processes. This article outlines the application of these methodologies with specific emphasis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We demonstrate the use of our methods for assessing regional ventilation and perfusion and demonstrate early data that show, in a sheep model, a regionally intact hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor (HPV) response with an apparent inhibition of HPV regionally in the presence of inflammation. We present the hypothesis that, in subjects with pulmonary emphysema, one major contributing factor leading to parenchymal destruction is the lack of a regional blunting of HPV when the regional hypoxia is related to regional inflammatory events (bronchiolitis or alveolar flooding). If maintaining adequate blood flow to inflamed lung regions is critical to the nondestructive resolution of inflammatory events, the pathologic condition whereby HPV is sustained in regions of inflammation would likely have its greatest effect in the lung apices where blood flow is already reduced in the upright body posture.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether focal changes of airflow obstruction within the lungs of patients with asthma vary or are fixed in location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction. With hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance (H(3)HeMR) imaging, the airspaces are depicted and focal areas of airflow obstruction are shown as "ventilation defects."
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regional changes of airflow obstruction with time and repeated bronchoconstriction.
METHODS: H(3)HeMR and spirometry were performed before (pre) and immediately after (post) methacholine challenge in 10 young patients with asthma on 2 days that were 7-476 days (mean, 185.3 +/- 37.2 days) apart. Pair-wise image comparisons were performed to determine the change in location of ventilation defects within the lung and their change in size.
RESULTS: When comparing premethacholine versus premethacholine and postmethacholine versus post-methacholine images of the 2 days, 41% +/- 10% and 69% +/- 5% (P = .017) of defects, respectively, were in the same location, and of those, 69% +/- 12% and 43% +/- 5% (P = .022), respectively, did not change size. Comparing premethacholine versus postmethacholine images, 58% +/- 9% of defects were in the same location on day 1 and 73% +/- 7% (P = .088) on day 2. On both days, the percent increase in defect number from premethacholine to postmethacholine was much greater than the percent decrease in spirometric values (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Many of the ventilation defects persisted or recurred in the same location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction, suggesting that the regional changes of airflow obstruction are relatively fixed within the lung.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings give new insight into the regional airflow variability within the lungs of patients with asthma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate characterization of asthma severity is difficult due to the variability of symptoms. Hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI (H(3)HeMR) is a new technique in which the airspaces are visualized, depicting regions with airflow obstruction as "ventilation defects." The objective of this study was to compare the extent of H(3)HeMR ventilation defects with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.
METHODS: Patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma and normal control subjects underwent H(3)HeMR. For each person, the number and size of ventilation defects were scored and the average number of ventilation defects per slice (VDS) was calculated. The correlations of the imaging findings with measures of asthma severity and spirometry were determined.
RESULTS: There were 58 patients with asthma (mild-intermittent, n = 13; mild-persistent, n = 13; moderate-persistent, n = 20; and severe-persistent, n = 12) and 18 control subjects. Mean +/- SE VDS for asthmatics was significantly greater than for control subjects (0.99 +/- 0.15 vs 0.26 +/- 0.22, p = 0.004). Among asthmatics, VDS was significantly higher for the group with moderate-persistent and severe-persistent disease than for the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (1.37 +/- 0.24 vs 0.53 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001). VDS correlated significantly with FEV(1)/FVC (r = - 0.51, p = 0.002), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% from the beginning of FVC (FEF(25-75%)) percentage of predicted for height, sex, and race (%predicted) [r = - 0.50, p = 0.001], and FEV(1) %predicted (r = - 0.40, p = 0.002), but not with FVC %predicted (r = - 0.26, p = 0.057) and peak expiratory flow %predicted (r = - 0.16, p = 0.231). Many asthmatics had an elevated VDS, but their spirometric indexes, except FEF(25%-75%), were normal. Most ventilation defects were < 3 cm in size for all asthmatics. In the group of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, there were more defects > or =3 cm than in the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (p = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Regional changes of airflow obstruction in asthmatics depicted by H(3)HeMR correlate with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex genetic disorder in which environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke, interact with genetic susceptibility to cause disease. Airway obstruction in COPD is due to an exaggerated inflammatory response that ultimately destroys the lung parenchyma (emphysema) and increases airway resistance by remodeling the airway wall. Until recently, assessment of these disease processes required the examination of resected tissue. However, computed tomography (CT) now allows researchers to measure the structure of the lung parenchyma and airway wall without having to remove the tissue. This review describes some of the new CT techniques for quantitative assessment of lung structure. These techniques are extremely important to study the pathogenesis of COPD as well as differentiate patients with predominantly emphysema disease from those with airway wall remodeling, and to assess the effects of therapeutic interventions.},

Hyperpolarized 3He magnetic resonance (MR) lung imaging is a new technology that provides a detailed image of lung ventilation. Hyperpolarized 3He lung imaging was performed in 10 asthmatics and 10 healthy subjects. Seven asthmatics had ventilation defects distributed throughout the lungs compared with none of the normal subjects. These ventilation defects were more numerous and larger in the two symptomatic asthmatics who had abnormal spirometry. Ventilation defects studied over time demonstrated no change in appearance over 30-60 minutes. One asthmatic subject was studied twice in a three-week period and had ventilation defects which resolved and appeared in that time. This same subject was studied before and after bronchodilator therapy, and all ventilation defects resolved after therapy. Hyperpolarized 3He lung imaging can detect the small, reversible ventilation defects that characterize asthma. The ability to visualize lung ventilation offers a direct method of assessing asthmatics and their response to therapy.},

	abstract = {Non-uniform distribution of inspired gas within the lung, termed ventilation heterogeneity, is present in patients with even mild asthma. Current evidence strongly supports ventilation heterogeneity as a fundamental derangement of lung function in asthma that contributes per se to hypoxemia and airway hyper-responsiveness. An extreme example of ventilation heterogeneity is the identification by hyperpolarized gas MRI of lung regions with no ventilation, termed filling defects. Lung filling defects in patients with asthma can persist over time, increase in size with methacholine-induced bronchospasm and more likely are caused by obstruction of the peripheral and not the proximal airways. Ventilation heterogeneity can be quantified in the conducting and acinar lung zones with the multiple gas washout method, and in the acinar zone does not fully resolve following bronchodilator treatment in patients with asthma. In prospective studies, the degree of ventilation heterogeneity at baseline predicts airway hyper-responsiveness and response to corticosteroid dose titration. An important unanswered question is the relationship of airways inflammation to ventilation heterogeneity. In consideration of the importance of ventilation heterogeneity in its pathobiology, asthma is more a focal disorder with regional pathology akin to regional ileitis and not the generalized disorder of the airways as it has been viewed in the past.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces. Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces. Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic analysis was performed on three volunteers.
RESULTS: Tag lines in inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous 3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged (3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},
