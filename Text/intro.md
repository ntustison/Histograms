Early hyperpolarized gas pulmonary imaging research reported findings in
qualitative terms.

Descriptions:

* "$^{3}$He MRI depicts anatomical structures reliably" [@Bachert:1996aa]

* "hypointense areas" [@Kauczor:1996aa]

* "signal intensity inhomogeneities" [@Kauczor:1996aa]

* "wedge-shaped areas with less signal intensity" [@Kauczor:1996aa]

* "patchy or wedge-shaped defects" [@Kauczor:1997aa]

* "ventilation defects" [@Altes:2001aa]

* "defects were pleural-based, frequently wedge-shaped, and varied in size from tiny to segmental" [@Altes:2001aa]


Subsequently, initial attempts at quantification were limited to ennumerating
the number of "ventilation defects" or estimating ventilation defect percentage
(as a percentage of total lung volume).

Additional sophistication:

* linear binning
* (semi-automated) k-means
* some percentage of the global mean intensity
* Gaussian mixture modeling with Markov Random Field prior-based smoothing
